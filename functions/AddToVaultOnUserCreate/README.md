# AddToVaultOnUserCreate

This function is designed to interact with the customer vault upon user creation, update, or deletion in an Appwrite project. It utilizes the Appwrite SDK for server-side operations and is executed automatically in response to user events.

## üß∞ Usage

This function does not directly handle HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE. Instead, it is triggered by user creation, update, or deletion events within your Appwrite project.

Upon execution, the function checks if the user is being created or updated. If the user is new, it adds the user to the customer vault. If the user's details are being updated, it updates the user's information in the customer vault accordingly.
